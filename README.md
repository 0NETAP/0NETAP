##Hello welcome to my github

Im gian/guap what ever you know me as and im from Dallas Texas. Ive been expermenting with coding for sometime now ever since ive been playing Garrys mod on steam. Ive owned about 4 servers on Garrys mod and i have tinkerd a little bit with LUA not enough to understand it though. After Garrys mod i took a break from coding and started to play valorant. Now i i came back only to browse though github and use useful tools and share those tools with people for education purposes.
